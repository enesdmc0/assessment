## Executive Summary

Found several critical issues causing production instability. Main problems: memory leaks from service instantiation, wrong tRPC adapter blocking authentication, N+1 queries killing database performance, and missing cleanup in React components. Fixed authentication blocker and working through memory leaks. These issues would crash the app under load.

## Part 1: Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Wrong tRPC Adapter Breaking Authentication

**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Architecture
**Location**: `server/context.ts:10`

**Description**:
Context function used Pages Router adapter (`CreateNextContextOptions`) but app uses App Router with fetch adapter. Headers API is different between them. Result: all API requests got 401 even with valid tokens.

**Impact**:
App completely unusable. No authenticated requests work. Users can't create projects, view data, or use any feature. Database operations fail silently.

**Root Cause**:
Next.js 15 App Router uses `fetchRequestHandler` with Web standard Request object (Headers API). Old code expected Next.js-specific request format from Pages Router. `req.headers.authorization` returns undefined because headers are accessed via `.get()` method in fetch adapter.

**Solution**:
Changed context adapter from `CreateNextContextOptions` to `FetchCreateContextFnOptions`. Updated header access from `req.headers.authorization` to `req.headers.get('authorization')`. Also updated client to read token dynamically on each request instead of only at mount.

**Trade-offs**:
None. This is the correct adapter for App Router. Previous code was fundamentally incompatible with the routing system being used.
